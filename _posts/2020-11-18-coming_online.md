## Hello World

Welcome the the SAPNull Blog! It's been a long time coming, but finally here.

I've been meaning to start a blog and manage it for a while, but never really took the time or put in the efforts to see it come to fruition, but that ends today!

## What to expect

I have a few blog articles and posts in mind that I will start working on and sharing. These mainly stem from my experience and views/perspective of working in the tech industry.

I also be putting in notes and snippets I use on a daily basis and sharing some of that work as well.
